Lab Questions
=======================
1. val it = [4,2,5,2,6,10] : int list

2. The function f goes through the list, adding 1 to each part and putting it
back in the list, calls itself recursively

3. First line defines the function as taking in a list of unspecified type,
which is later inferred based on operations to be an int list.  It also
states that an empty list, should just be an empty list, basically a nil check.

4. Second line calls the function again, on the head and rest of the list, with
recursive calls for the list until the end is reached.  As each element is
selected one is added to it, and it is re-added to the list.

11. ML seems to be a very powerful language once it is understood.  For math
or calculation purposes it has more concise functionality than other languages

12. ML is very hard to understand at first, it takes a lot of time and research
into the language to grasp its syntax and symbols, or at least for me it did.

15. I might use ML again if I have a problem I feel it would be suited to solve.
Perhaps some kind of calculation or something best solved with recursion.
